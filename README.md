<h1> CS 109- DATA SCIENCE COURSE </h1>
<p> This is my lectures practices and homework from this course. All exercises are in R because I'm R's fanatic. Python was one 
of my first language programing but when I discovered R for this cool things I believe that is a great tool I like to say not better
than python but for me more useful, by the way It's an opinion. Other reason for did all exercises in R is because I want
to put my point of view in public.</p>

<p> This course is a great oportunity for people like me that we want to study data science.</p>
